I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science in the Information Systems and Analytics Department and a Faculty Fellow of the Center for Health and Behavioral Sciences at Bryant University. An ACUE certified instructor, I teach Information Systems and Analytics (ISA) and Applied Analytics (AA) classes. My research interests include mobile health, health informatics, natural language processing, machine learning, generative modeling, human-computer interaction, computational sociology, accessibility, and sustainability. 

I completed my Data Science PhD from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Spring 2022. My dissertation research is part of the [Emutivo](https://emutivo.wpi.edu) project focusing on screening for mental illnesses with text logs collected using mobile applications. 

I enjoy writing, solving puzzles, and walking with my dog Bumper.
