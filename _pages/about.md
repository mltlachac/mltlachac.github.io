I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science in the Information Services and Analytics Department at Bryant University. My research interests include mobile health, health informatics, natural language processing, machine learning, generative modeling, human-computer interaction, mental health screening, computational sociology, accessibility, and sustainability. 

I completed my Data Science PhD from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Spring 2022. My dissertation research is part of the [Emutivo](https://emutivo.wpi.edu) project. My research focused on screening for mental illnesses with text data collected using mobile applications. 

I enjoy writing, solving puzzles, and walking with my dog Bumper.
