I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science in the Information Systems and Analytics Department and a Faculty Fellow of the Center for Health and Behavioral Sciences at Bryant University. An ACUE certified instructor, I teach Information Systems and Analytics (ISA) and Applied Analytics (AA) classes. 

My research interests include mobile health, health informatics, affective computing, machine learning, digital phenotyping, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, accessibility, and sustainability.

I completed my Data Science PhD from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Spring 2022. My dissertation research is part of the [Emutivo](https://emutivo.wpi.edu) project on digital mental health screening. 

I enjoy writing, solving puzzles, and walking with my dog Bumper.
