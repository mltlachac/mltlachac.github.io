## Research Mentor
My first research mentoring experience was for [Math 380: Research Methods in Mathematics](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/75501/Brushaber2Spr16.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) at UWEC in 2015. Since 2018, I've mentored 35+ students on the [Emutivo](https://emutivo.wpi.edu/) research project at WPI. The student teams I've mentored on this project include:
